Bloomberg:
>Apple first coordinates flights and trucks to move components from suppliers to assembly plants in China. Teams from sales, marketing, operations and finance collaborate to forecast how many devices the company expects to sell.

>The internal estimate is crucial. An example of how that can go wrong is Microsoft's recent [$900 million writedown](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-30/microsoft-sold-853-million-in-surface-tablets.html) because of unsold Surface tablets.

>Before Apple's formal unveiling on stage, iPhones are shipped to distribution centers around the world, including Australia, China, the Czech Republic, Japan, Singapore, the U.K. and the U.S. FedEx ships Apple handsets to the U.S. mainly using Boeing 777s... The 777s can carry about 450,000 iPhones and cost about $242,000 to charter, with fuel accounting for more than half the expense.

All the more impressive because of the massive number of SKUs (stock-keeping-units) this year.

- iPhone 4 (still sold in China) - 2 (2 colors)
- iPhone 4s - 2 (2 colors)
- iPhone 5c - 50 (5 colors x 2 storage capacities x 5 LTE bands)
- iPhone 5s - 45 (3 colors x 3 storage capacities x 5 LTE bands)

Total of 99 unique iPhones to forecast and manage production/inventory.
