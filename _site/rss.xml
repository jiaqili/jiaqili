<p>The world has changed in the last five years, and hundreds of millions of people now carry powerful, well-made, touchscreen computers with them everywhere they go.</p>

      <title>Why do Scalpers Exist?</title>
      <link>http://www.jiaqili.com/2013/08/28/why-do-scalpers-exist.html</link>

      <description><p>Priceonomics:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yet concerts and sporting events consistently price their tickets low enough that street scalpers risk jail time to hawk marked-up tickets, and StubHub makes hundreds of millions a year in revenue.</p>
